    <h1>Preparation</h1>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <strong>Step 1:</strong> Combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl. <br>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong>Add the oil and water and mix with your hands until a rough dough forms.<br>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong>Turn it out onto a lightly floured counter and knead for 10 minutes, until soft and silky.
    <strong>Step 4:</strong>Form it into a ball, place it on the counter and cover withtowel. Let rest for 30 minutes.<br>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <strong>Step 5:</strong>In a large bowl, peel all oranges and soak the peels in water.<br>
    <strong>Step 6:</strong>Zest lemon and blend with sugar and Cinamon<br>
    <strong>Step 7:</strong>Pick out whole berries in jam and keep as little liquid as possible<br>
    <strong>Step 8:</strong>Soak raisins in water in a bowl
    <h1>Assembling</h1>
    <strong>Step 9:</strong>After 30 minutes passed on the dough, start rolling out the dough. Roll out dough into an exlipse shape. The dough needs to be extremely thin, almost see through. If it rips, reform into a ball and restart. Leave the edges a little thicker <br>
    <strong>Step 10:</strong>After dough is rolled out, start assembling filling in lines going throughout the long side. <br>
    <strong>Step 11:</strong>First dry raisins
